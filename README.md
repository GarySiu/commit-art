# commit-art
I've had a bit of a break from commercial coding. This left a sad looking gap
in my github commit history. I people attach a lot of significance to how it
looks on the github map thingy so I felt a bit anxious about it.

So for a little bit of fun I decided to fill in my gap with a little artwork.

## 1. Prototyping in Excel

Because it's a quick way to paint squares and know the dimensions.

## 2. Convert to ascii-art
I didn't want to fiddle with CSV conversions so I literally just hand
transcribed it to a text file using "#" to represent commits.
## 3. Code!
I went with Ruby because it has good native support for dates and it's easy
to experiment with.
## 4. Profit?

Worked out pretty nicely. Now I can stop feeling anxious and get on with more
productive things. Turns out I'm 
[not the only person](https://github.com/gelstudios/gitfiti) that
had this idea. But I wanted to see if I can do it on my own. I'm pretty happy
with the outcome.
